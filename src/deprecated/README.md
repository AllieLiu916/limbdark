This is a graveyard of code which was used in development
of STARRY/limbdark trying out:

- different ways of computing the H_uv function
- different ways of computing M_pq
- s2 (linear limb-darkening) in terms of standard complete
  elliptic integrals
- derivatives of standard elliptic integrals
- estimating light travel time delays
